Data for Reviewer Matching, version 1.0
Assembled by David Mimno, University of Massachusetts, Amherst

CONTENTS

This package consists of five text formatted files:

titles.txt
Titles and authors for 148 papers from NIPS 2006.

abstracts.txt
Abstracts from those papers.

reviewers.txt
The reviewers from NIPS 2005 (2006 reviewers were not
available at the time), each with an ID.

trec_judgments.txt
Relevance judgments in trec_eval format. Each NIPS 2006 paper is assigned
an ID in the form nips[xx] where xx is the order of that paper in the
file abstracts.txt, starting with 0 for the first line. The first column
of the file is the paper ID, the second column is not used, the third
is the reviewer ID, and the final column is the minimum relevance
judgment obtained for that reviewer from any participant.

training.txt
This tab delimited file consist of slightly less than 15,000 author/paper
pairs. The first column is the name of the author. The second column 
contains the title of the paper and the abstract, if available. All papers
are drawn from the Rexa database, which uses automated information extraction.
As a result, there may be missing or extraneous text. I have made an effort,
however, to hand disambiguate authors, although I make no guarantees about
how thorough I was able to be. Papers that have more than one reviewer 
candidate as an author are duplicated, once for each author.
